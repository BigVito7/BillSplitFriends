Hi,
This is my app, where you can split the bill between friends in restaurant, party or at home.
First, add product list that you bought and the price per each product (food, drinks)
Then you go to Users page and creat who was and (if he bought something) write amount of money (if he spend nothing, then write "0")
After this you need to go to product list page and each user have to select the product that he eat or drink.
Annd the results, how much each have to pay (add to bank).
